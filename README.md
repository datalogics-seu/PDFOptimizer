# PDFOptimizer
scripts for running PDFOptimizer

-- RunPDFOptimizer.ps1 -- Powershell script that will process all files in a folder (not recursive)

-- RunPDFOptimizer.py -- Python script that will process all files in a folder (not recursive). Only tested on Windows, but should work on other platforms.

-- RunPDFOptimizerBatch.bat -- Windows .bat script that will process all files in a folder (not recursive). Ugh, arcane syntax. Works, but no promises. Did not test with spaces in folder/file path.
